/**
 * @brief The Geom class
 *
 * A Geom is a fixed piece of geometry, like Actors they are
 * constructed from a mesh, but unlike actors they are completely
 * immovable during their lifetime. This gives partitioners
 * the freedom to split the geometry as necessary for improved performance
 * or even store entirely cached versions of the geometry.
 *
 * Also unlike an actor, a mesh is a requirement.
