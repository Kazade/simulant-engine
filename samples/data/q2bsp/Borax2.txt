Description             : My first Quake II level.  Its a kind of base style 
                          level like those in the first unit, but it still
                          somewhat original.

STORY:
		After the defeat of Stroggos in the First Earth-Strogg war, the asteriod belt
was the last fortress, the last retreat for the surviving strogg.  Here they are
at least able to from some sort of resistance, although any strike against earth is now 
thankfully impossible.  The government of the Coalition of Man has decided to strip mine the
mineral rich asteriods, but the strogg must be eradicated first before they can proceed.

	You and your small platoon of 3 were ordered to infiltrate and shut down the 
Electromagnetic Generator on Asteriod A-342-44F2, containing a facility known only as Borax II.  
Shutting this down will allow air strikes.  The generator must be shut down to shut down any 
small scale force fields that may be created using this field.  You were also ordered to 
capture the Air Strike marker as it could be used by the strogg to controll the Coalition's
missiles.  By using the Air Strike marker and computer equipment, 
the strogg may be able to re-direct the missiles.  

	You bring the Viper to a rough landing after a Dog fight with Strogg planes above the
asteriod.  Bullets had penetraded the glass killing Wills and O'Brien, injuring Falkenberg and
leaving you the only one able to fight.  You only have a Blaster, Flakenberg has a shotgun,
but he is now insane.  

	You are on your own, the decision is yours.  You decide to go it alone, and to get
the shotgun off him by any means possible......

Single Player           : Yes
Cooperative             : Yes, Quite a few starts
Deathmatch              : Yes, Quite a few starts, but I
                          didn't design it with deathmatch in mind.  If
                          you are looking for a good big deathmatch level,
                          this probably isn't it, but I may be wrong!
Difficulty Settings     : Yes.  Easy isn't too easy though.
New Sounds              : No
New Graphics            : No
New Music               : No
Demos Replaced          : None

* Additional Information *

Have fun plating, ammo is somewhat tight and you may run out if you are careless.
Don't worry, there is enough, just not load of ammo and grenades.  Personally, I don't like
balanced weapons.  Having 50 grenades and rockets kinda sucks.  I like Doom's style, where
rockets were sparse, but powerful.  You only get 5 grenades in the level!  Use them wisely.

I don't have a 3D card (this makes QERadiant difficult to use, but I can still use it), so 
I don't really know what the coloured lighting is like.  I kept it to a minimum so as not to 
get ugly colour combo's.  It should look O.K. though, but there is less coloured ligting than
usual.
