(ii) As purchased by a game's creators as part of a game if the Content is contained inside a proprietary format and displays inside the game during play, but not for users to re-package as goods distributed or sold inside a virtual world.

(iii) As Content published within a book, poster, t-shirt or other item.

(iv) As part of a physical object such as a toy, doll, or model.

(a) resale or redistribution by the Member of any Content obtained from TurboSquid, whether For Sale or freely available for download, whether part of a Valid Sale or not, unless it is used as Incorporated Content as licensed above;

(b) selling, distributing, or licensing, whether For Sale or freely available for download, any static imagery which features Content as stock photography, or collection thereof, through an online stock photography/stock content clearinghouse website;

(c) any other distribution that would require a written grant of rights greater than that contained in paragraph 3 above. Member understands that all other rights or sub-divisions of rights generally included in copyright are excluded from this license and remain the property of Seller.
