# Stage Nodes

Each `Stage` is the root of a heirachy of `StageNodes`. Classes that inherit `StageNode` are:

 - `Stage`
 - `Actor`
 - `ParticleSystem`
 - `Geom`
 - `Camera`
 - `Light`
 
These are the basic building blocks of your scene.

## Building a Heirarchy

`StageNodes` can be parents and children of other `StageNodes`. To build this heirarchy you make use of the `StageNode::set_parent` method. `set_parent` can take a node ID, or the node itself.

All `StageNodes` by default are children of the `Stage` they belong to. If you want to detach a node from its parent (and reparent it under the `Stage`) then simply pass a `nullptr` to `set_parent`:

```
auto a1 = stage_->new_actor();
auto a2 = stage_->new_actor();
a2->set_parent(a1);

// a1 is now a2's parent

a2->set_parent(nullptr);

// a1 and a2 are now both direct children of stage_
```

## Traversal

There are a number of ways to traverse your stage heirarchy but they are all exposed through
standard C++ begin/end pairs designed to be used with C++ range for-loops. The below code
shows a number of examples of traversing a stage's tree:

```
for(auto node: stage->each_descendent()) {}  // Root-to-leaf iteration

for(auto node: actor->each_ancestor()) {} // Traverse up the tree

for(auto node: actor->each_sibling()) {} // Iterate the siblings of the actor

for(auto node: stage->each_child()) {} // Iterate direct-children only
```

# Updating of StageNode and their Behaviours

`StageNodes` are only updated if the owning `Stage` is attached to an active `Pipeline`. You can check this by checking `Stage::is_part_of_active_pipeline()`. 

It is highly recommended that if you are manipulating a `Stage` in a background thread (e.g. in the `load()` method of a `Scene`) that you do not attach the `Stage` to a pipeline until you are finished manipulating. This should prevent threading problems.

# Destruction

You can destroy a `StageNode` by calling its `destroy()` method. This won't release the `StageNode` immediately, but it will fire the `signal_destroyed` signal. The actual clean-up of the node will happen after `late_update()`, but before the render queue is built. This helps prevent issues where queued tasks try to access deleted nodes.

When the clean-up process runs, an additional `signal_cleaned_up` signal will fire just before deletion of the node.

## Delayed Destruction

`StageNodes` have a helper method called `destroy_after(Seconds)` that you can call to fire `destroy()` after the number of seconds have passed. Internally this simply queues a coroutine to call `destroy()`. Be aware, `destroy_after` is a fire-and-forget method - you can't cancel once you've triggered it! 

 > Note: `is_marked_for_destruction()` will return false until the elapsed time has passed, and `destroy()` has been called.

## Finding nodes

You can give stage nodes names using `StageNode::set_name`, and later search for those nodes recursively using `StageNode::find_descendent_with_name`. If a name is duplicated, only the first match found
will be returned.

You can set a name during construction of a stage node by chaining using the `set_name_and_get(name)` method:

```
auto actor = stage->new_actor()->set_name_and_get("Actor 1");
```

# Disabling Culling

By default, stage nodes (excluding cameras) will be culled with a scene partitioner if they are deemed to be offscreen. You can disable this behaviour for a stage node by toggling its cullable state:

```
node->set_cullable(false);  // Will always be renderered
assert(!node->is_cullable());
```

# Linking StageNode Positions

Sometimes it's useful for a stage node to be "attached" to another node, without forming a parent child relationship. An example would be a Skybox, which should always stay surrounding the camera, but shouldn't follow the camera's rotation - and also doesn't conceptually make sense to be a child of the camera. For this reason `StageNode::link_position(node)` exists. The following code would make `actor` synchronise its position with `camera`.

```
auto actor = stage->new_actor();
auto camera = stage->new_camera();

actor->link_position(camera);
```

 > Note: the linked node will update its position at the end of `late_update` phase, therefore its possible that the position will not match what you would expect during `update`, `fixed_update`, or `late_update` but the position 
 will synchronise before rendering.
